# NMS-translator
This translator is a small web app that easily translates from English to one of the four alien languages in the video game No Man's Sky.

## How it looks
Well I'm not good with front end Web developpment so you just have 2 boxes and a language selector. If anyone is willing to improve this, feel free to contribute!

## How it's made
The script ([script.js](../script.js)) is fully made in Javascript, and uses a page ([translator.html](../translator.html)) written in HTML. There's no CSS yet.
The dictionnary ([dictionnary.js](../dictionnary.js)) for all the translations is made of four JS associative arrays, named by the language they translate to.

## How you can help
I'm open to contributions! I don't have any particular guideline or rules, however it is my personal project, all my decisions are arbitrary.
